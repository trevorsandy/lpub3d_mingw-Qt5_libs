			     Introduction

LdLite is an LDRAW file viewer for Windows.  You can use it to view
DAT and MPD files containing models made with everyone's favorite 
construction bricks.

LdGLite is a platform independent version of LdLite.  It achieves this
by using the OpenGL graphics interface and the GLUT toolkit.  It 
currently runs in Windows, Linux, and MacOS.  It does not yet provide
all of the functionality of LdLite.  However it does have a few small
goodies not yet available in LdLite.

L3Glite is ldglite except it uses the L3 parser.  Actually the executables
are identical, the program decides which parser to use based on the name
of the program.  On linux you can softlink l3glite to ldglite.  You can
also force the program to use a specific parser with a -ld or -l3 command
line option.

As of version 0.9.1 if you call the program something with "ledit" in
it such as ldgledit or l3gledit it will start up automatically in
LEDIT emulation mode.  This can also be accomplished with the -le or -lE
command line option.  Currently LEDIT emulation mode always uses the
l3 parser.


                        LdGLite for Windows README

You must have a copy of opengl32.dll installed.  This comes with
Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Windows NT.  If you use
an early version of Windows 95 then you must get opengl95.exe from
Microsoft and install it.

    ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe

You must also install the GLUT dll in the appropriate directory.  For
Windows 95 and 98 copy glut32.dll to the windows\system directory.
For Windows NT and 2000 copy glut32.dll to the winnt\system32
directory.

You must also install the ldraw parts files from www.ldraw.org.

    c:
    cd \
    mkdir c:\ldraw
    cd c:\ldraw
    ldraw.exe -y
    complete.exe -y

For ldglite to find the parts you must set the environment variable
LDRAWDIR.  Add this line to your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file and reboot your
PC.  

    SET LDRAWDIR=C:\LDRAW

As of version 7.1 ldglite can also use the BaseDirectory setting in 
ldraw.ini to find the parts files.  The ldraw.ini file is created by
LDAO and various other ldraw type programs.

To use ldglite from MS Internet Explorer do this:

    1) Open an Explorer window (or any folder window).
    2) Select the "View->Folder Options" menu selection.
       ("Tools->Folder Options" on 2000.)
    3) Go to the "File Types" tab.
    4) Scroll down and double click on the "ldlite Document" line.  
       If there is no "ldlite Document" line, click the "New Type" button
       and enter "ldlite Document" in the "Description of type" field
       and ".dat" for the "Associated extension".
    5) In the "Content Type" field, type in "application/x-ldraw"
    6) In the "Actions" area, Click on the "New..." button.  
       For the Action name, type "open".  
       For the filename, browse to the location of ldglite.exe

Or on the command line of windows 2000 type something like this:
    
    ldlite.document=C:\some\directory\l3glite.exe -v3 -& "%1"
    assoc .dat=ldlite.document
    assoc .mpd=ldlite.document
    assoc .ldr=ldlite.document
    

For Netscape:

    1) Go to the Netscape menu item Edit/Preferences/Navigator/Applications.
    2) Select "ldlite Document".   
       If you don't find "ldlite Document" then add it.
    3) Edit, and set the mime type to application/x-ldraw.
    4) Browse for the ldglite.exe executable.



                        LdGLite for linux README

You must install the basic ldraw files from www.ldraw.org

    cd /usr/local
    mkdir ldraw
    cd ldraw
    unarj x ldraw.exe 
    unarj x complete.exe

The default directory for ldraw dat files is /usr/local/ldraw.
If you wish to install the files elsewhere, set the environment
variable LDRAWDIR

    LDRAWDIR=/var/ldraw
    export LDRAWDIR

The default case for dat files in the p and parts subdirectories
is lowercase.  If you want to use uppercase set the environment
variable LDRAWIRCASE

    LDRAWDIRCASE=UPPERCASE
    export LDRAWDIR

Unzip the ldglite distribution.  I zipped it with infozip which is free
on the web.  (I'm skipping the usual .tgz file since geocities seems to
choke on it.)  The Mandrake 6.1 linux distribution came with an unzip
utility preinstalled in /usr/bin. 

You must build ldglite

    make -f makefile.linux
    cp ldglite /usr/local/bin
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/ldglite /usr/local/bin/l3glite

Of course this assumes you have Mesa or some other OpenGL installed.
I had to make some softlinks for the Mesa libs on my Mandrake 6.1
linux distribution before the ldglite would link.

    cd /usr/X11R6/lib
    ln -s libMesaGLU.so libGLU.so
    ln -s libMesaGL.so libGL.so

I think the makefile also assumes you have libpng and libz installed.
Check makefile.linux for instructions on how to skip them if you have 
trouble linking.

For Netscape, go to the Netscape menu item
Edit/Preferences/Navigator/Applications, select "ldlite Document",
Edit, and set the mime type to application/x-ldraw.  If you don't find 
"ldlite Document" then add it.
Set the executable like this.  

    /usr/local/bin/ldglite %s

Feel free to substitute whatever path you use for the executable.  The
%s is required to pass the temporary filename of the dat file to
ldglite.  If you want a 640x480 window with shading turned on try something
like this.  See ldlite docs for help with command line options. 

    /usr/local/bin/ldglite -v3 -fh %s



                        LdGLite for DOS README

You must install the basic ldraw files from www.ldraw.org

    c:
    cd \
    mkdir c:\ldraw
    cd c:\ldraw
    ldraw.exe -y
    complete.exe -y

For ldglite to find the parts you must set the environment variable
LDRAWDIR.  Add this line to your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT file and reboot your
PC.  

    SET LDRAWDIR=C:\LDRAW

You need to run the csdpmi5b DOS extender for this to work unless you
are using Windows 95 or 98 DOS mode.  You also seem to need at least
64 MB.  (Not sure about that though)  Finally you need to redirect stdout
to a file to avoid some garbage at the top of the screen.

    ldglite myfile.dat >messages.txt




                             Extra Stuff


Command line options (see also the original ldlite docs for more):

-fh turns on shading mode.
-fs turns off stud drawing. (l3glite only)
-fsl draws studs as lines. (l3glite only)
-fe turns off edge lines 
-fr same as -fe (Render mode?  Rough draft?  I don't know what R stands for.)
-ffT,E,S,R,G,B turns on fogging 
   T = fogging type (1 = linear, 2 = exp2, 3 = exp3)
   E,S = end/far, start/near fog clip planes in linear mode.
   E,S = fog density, S= ignored param in exp mode.
   R,G,B = fog color (default = fade to white, try 0,0,0 for night scene)
   All fog params except T are optional.
   Try these:  -ff3,0.0004    -ff3,0.0003,0,0.8,0.8,1.0
-v0 displays in a 320x200 window.
-v-1 displays in fullscreen with no decorations.
-v-2 displays in fullscreen gamemode (no menus in gamemode).
-v7 displays in 1600x1024
-v8 displays in 1600x1200
-vX,Y displays in an X wide by Y high window.
-x displays the x,y,z axis.
-ms Saves an image for each STEP and quits.
-mS Does the same, but without opening a window.
-iN picks output image type. 1 = PNG, 2 = Transparent PNG, 3 = BMP8, 4 = BMP24 
    5 = PPM.  Use -N to turn off output image cropping.
-eN.NN fixes polyline offset driver errors.  Try -e0.95 if lines look bad.
-p turns on polling mode.
-ld forces the program to use the ldlite parser.
-l3 forces the program to use the l3 parser.
-le starts the program in LEDIT emulation mode. 
-lE starts the program in LEDIT emulation mode with solid moving pieces.
-ledit or -LEDIT do the same but with draw-to-current and stud-as-line on.
-wN sets linewidth to N.
-q quality lines (antialiased)
-J picks the perspective projection.
-zN sets the near clipping plane.  (default = 10.  100 if GL_DEPTH_BITS < 24)
-ZN sets the far clipping plane.  (default = 4000)
-caN sets the camera FOV angle in degrees.  (like l3p, except default = 45)
-ccX,Y,Z sets the camera location.  (like l3p, except default = 0,0,1000)
-coX,Y,Z sets the model origin for the camera to look at.  (default = 0,0,0)
-cuX,Y,Z sets the camera up vector.  (default = 0,0,1)
-lcX,Y,Z sets the light location.  (like l3p, except default = -1000,1000,1000)
-lcX,Y,Z,R,G,B sets the light location and color.
-lCR,G,B sets the ambient lighting color.
-uX,Y saves a huge output image from window sized tiles.  (see notes below)
-& windows mode.  Detach from the console window.  Windows version only.
-- if no DAT filename is given on the command line ldglite will read
   from stdin.  (l3glite does not do this)  Try this:
     cat file.dat | ldglite -v3 -ms -- 
   Kinda neat, but I don't know if this is good for much.  Perhaps if you
   have an application that generates dat files you can pipe the output
   through ldglite and produce an image file.  For example ldrawmode for
   emacs could possibly be extended to use this to send a dat file in the
   buffer out to the printer.  (especially if I add postscript output)
=LDConfig.ldr file. Optionally, you can include an LDConfig.ldr filename
   as an command line argument. e.g. =foo\\CustomLDConfig.ldr. If not used, 
   ldglite will attempt to load the LDConfig.ldr from the default locations 
   (LDRAWDIR and CWD).

Hot Keys (especially useful in fullscreen gamemode):
NOTE:  A few keys were changed in 0.9.0 to accomodate LEDIT emulation mode.

F10 enters fullscreen gamemode.  (May be faster on some video cards)
F9 exits fullscreen gamemode.
Right Mouse button displays the popup menu.
Left Mouse Drag will rotate the model.
Shift Mouse Drag rotates the model in solid bounding box mode.
Ctrl Mouse Drag rotates the model in solid studless mode.
Arrow keys turn the viewpoint camera 5 degrees left, right, up, down.
Alt Arrow keys roll the camera left, right, up, down.
Ctrl Arrow keys move the camera left, right, up, down.
PGUP and PGDN move the camera in and out (only visible in perspective mode)
0-9 keys pick one of the preset viewpoints.
+ scales the model up to double size. (ALT +  zooms in 10%)
- shrinks the model by half.  (ALT -  zooms out 10%)
S attempts to scale the model to fit the window.  Needs work though.
s toggles step/continuous mode
g toggles polling mode.
j picks the orthographic projection.
J picks the perspective projection.
r toggles the parser (LdLite or L3)
n turns on normal (no) shading.
h turns on shading.
l turns on line only wireframe mode.
f toggles stud drawing.
V toggles visible spin mode.
b prints a BMP file. (use CTRL-b for 24 bit BMP)
B prints a PNG file. (use CTRL-B for Alpha transparency)
q toggles line quality (antialiasing)
Esc quits.

INSERT key toggles LEDIT emulation mode.  
(use CTRL-INSERT if you want to render the moving part solid)

An excellent description of the LEDIT Hot Keys can be found at:
  http://library.thinkquest.org/20551/keys.html

			   LEDIT extensions

The LEDIT emulation currently contains an extension to the linetype menu
to allow adding primitive linetypes 2-5.  The parser for this ignores
commas and parenthesis so you can enter the points for a type 2 line
like this if you wish:

Enter Coords for Type 2 Primitive: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (10.0, 10.0, 10.0)

The color defaults to 16 for filled primitives and 24 for line primitives.

Also, in addition to the x,y,z keys to translate the piece along an axis,
you can now use the v key to translate by an (x,y,z) vector.

The Piece menu now also contains:
  an (x,y,z) location option 
  an (x,y,z) scale option (use negative numbers to mirror)
  a matrix replacement option.
  an part inliner option.

			LEDIT emulation quirks

Part lookup is not currently supported.  Try the printable parts catalog.
  http://moon.pr.erau.edu/~sayrew/lego.html
Windows users can also use ldlist or the VEC from LDAO for part lookup.
  http://user.tninet.se/~hbh828t/ldlist.htm
  http://www.ldraw.org/download/software/ldao

Empty lines are discarded by the L3 parser.  Use a blank comment instead.


				Notes

Lugnet news article http://news.lugnet.com/cad/?n=5344 describes
how linux users can use ldglite to convert DAT or MPD files to GIF 
and JPEG.

LDGLite (see http://www.ldraw.org/reference/linux for installation
instructions on Linux) can convert DAT and MPD files to PNG:

  ldglite-run -i2 -ms model.mpd

Using netpbm/pbmplus (and tcsh) it is easy to convert the PNG files
to GIF and JPEG:

  foreach file ( /usr/local/share/ldraw/bitmap/model*.png )
    pngtopnm < ${file} | cjpeg > `basename ${file} .png`.jpeg
    pngtopnm < ${file} | ppmtogif > `basename ${file} .png`.gif
  end

And if you want to improve the looks of the model, you can render
the model in double size, and then scale down the images:

  ldglite-run -i2 -ms -s2 -w2 model.mpd

  foreach file ( /usr/local/share/ldraw/bitmap/model*.png )
    pngtopnm < ${file} | pnmscale 0.5 | cjpeg > `basename ${file} .png`.jpeg
    pngtopnm < ${file} | pnmscale 0.5 | ppmtogif > `basename ${file} .png`.gif
  end

		       -----------------------

Use -uX,Y on the command line to build and save an image larger than
the screen made out of several tiles, each the size of the ldglite
window.  This can be used in combination with the -W option for wide
lines and/or the -Q switch for antialiased lines to generate high
quality instructions.  Currently this dumps PPM files instead of BMP
files.  PNG works, but transparent backgrounds and cropping are not
supported in tiled mode.  Ldglite automatically exits after saving the
images (much like the -MS mode).  The following command renders
the model in double size and saves a 2000 by 2000 PNG file.  It uses
the l3 parser so it only has to parse the mpd file once for the multiple
rendering passes required for the tiles.

  ldglite -l3 -i2 -s2 -w2 -u2000,2000 model.mpd

		       -----------------------

Use -mS (uppercase S) to save images without even opening a window.
This is nice for background rendering processes.  Use this in
combination with -vX,Y to set the image size.  This currently does NOT
work in conjunction with the tiled rendering mode, but perhaps by the
next release.  To get large images with the offscreen MESA driver
you'll need to edit the MESA config file src/config.h and change
MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT, then recompile MESA.  Linux users can also
use the X Virtual FrameBuffer (xvfb) to render offscreen.  I suspect
xvfb may also require the changes to the MESA config file to produce
large images.

# lpub3d_mingw-Qt_libs
LPub3D Qt runtime libraries for x86_64 and i686 architectures on AppVeyor

This repositoy stores pre-built Qt 5.9.2-2 runtime libraries needed to compile LPub3D 32 and 64bit distributions on AppVeyor CI.
Each package contains only the release binaries; thus, reducing the transfer file size of each package  to approx 30+ MB versus the 600+ MB for the default pre-built libraries.
